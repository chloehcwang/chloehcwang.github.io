        <h3>Shanghai</h3>
        <p>
          My 10th birthday present was an Olympus film camera. The first camera
          in my life also brought my first income. I became a young reporter for
          Shanghai kid's news.10 yuan for a piece of news($2). <br />Which
          photos I took at the time are very blurry when I think about it now.
          But I still clearly remember the joy that I had was sending my film
          away to get it developed. That was something to look forward, even if
          I had no idea what I had taken. The uncertain outcome, which to me
          “feels like magic”.

        <h3>Tokyo</h3>
        <p>
          Because of my love for Japanese anime, in college, I learned Japanese
          art and language. After graduation, I joined a Japanese company, where
          my work included translation, designing company magazines, brochures
          for marketing, and business cards. <br />
          Due to the internal transfer, I then joined the HR department. I have
          applied my psychology knowledge and acquired interpersonal skills
          through my work in human resources.

        <h3>Auckland</h3>
        <p>
          After moving to Auckland, I became a qualified early childhood
          teacher. I've learned empathy by caring for children who cannot talk
          yet. <br />
          After the experience with children, I started training adult educators
          as a program coordinator. I have gained skills in instructional design
          by facilitating workshops and making curricula for the children.
          <br />
          In my spare time, I run a small online business through Shopify,
          Amazon, and Taobao. During the process of learning eCommerce by
          myself, I found my interest in UX design. So I was determined to go
          back to school to learn systematically.
