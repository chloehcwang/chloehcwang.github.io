          Since we had so many details to design and were under time pressure,
          we needed to work rapidly, jumping straight from sketching to
          prototyping.
        </p>
        <p class="text-center">
          So I decided to use the Crazy 8 method. The purpose is to generate a
          number of different ideas within a short period of time.

        <p>
          Using the user flow as a guide, we did our own sketches using crazy 8
          and rated the parts that we liked.
        </p>
        <p class="text-center">
          After discussing the feasibility with the developers, our vision began
          evolving into something tangible. A high‚Äêlevel design language, and
          interactions began to piece together.
