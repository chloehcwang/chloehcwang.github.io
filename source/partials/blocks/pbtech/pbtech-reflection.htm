          At the time of submission, I had difficulty accepting the reality of
          this product, because I knew there were so much I could do. As it was
          a design challenge, I was unable to conduct stakeholder interviews
          .There was no opportunity to ask why.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I had more time, I would like to investigate deeper into the needs
          for the users. Additionally, I want to conduct an AB test to verify
          our improvements. Also gathering precise data for the next iteration.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am very proud of what we accomplished as a team. Iâ€™ve learned a lot
          about the perspectives from developers.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am so thankful to have had a team that was hard working and great to
          collaborate with.
