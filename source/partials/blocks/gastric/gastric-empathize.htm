      <p>
        By reading the given documents and adult app prototype, we get to know
        that Gastric Alimetryᵀᴹ is a non-invasive device that is worn in the
        clinic.
      </p>
      <p>
        The device delivers new validated biomarkers of gastric function, based
        on multi-award-winning scientific innovation.
      </p>
      <p>
        When combined with the recording of symptoms and feelings via the app,
        the Gastric Alimetryᵀᴹ technology aids in diagnosing and therapy.

        As an ECE teacher before, I noticed children in pre-school age can do
        some simple clicks but are more into dragging or sliding. Children's
        fine motor skills and cognitive development vary in thier early stages.
      </p>
      <p class="p-3">
        So I led a secondary research regarding children’s physical & cognitive
        capability towards using mobiles or tablets.

          Overcoming user research and testing constraints
        </h5>
        <p>
          The real users are children with gastric symptoms. But we've been told
          we were unable to run any tests with these kids. So the first
          challenge I encountered was how to empathise with users and validate
          hypothesis without access to real users ?
        </p>
        <p>
          To overcome the challenge, we first conducted external secondary
          research. We looked for academic journals, websites, articles, and
          videos in order to collect information about UX practice for children.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also decide to look for normal children to conduct usability tests.

          An Interesting finding for the next version
        </h4>
        <p>
          At first, I only knew that designing for children should consider fine
          motor skills and cognitive capability from my own experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          But with more research, there is a consistent finding of the need to
          target very narrow age groups when designing for children.
          <b
            >There's no such thing as "designing rules for children," defined as
            everybody for all age ranges.</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Each group has different behaviours and physical and cognitive
          capabilities. Young users reacted negatively to content designed for
          children who were even one school grade below or above their own level
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="container pt-5 pb-5">
    <div class="row d-flex justify-content-between">
      <div class="col-lg-3 d-flex flex-column justify-content-center">
        <p>
          So I suggested to design the app into two version with age 5 - 8 and
          age 9 -17. The client, however, prefers to start with just one version
          for all ages. After further discussion, we came to agree to stick with
          the current plan and make the product in 2 age groups in the future
          version 2.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this in mind, I tried to make my designs compatible with
          different age groups of children. I also tested this issue in the
          usability test to gather evidence and data for version 2 iteration.

          The aim is to make the app easier and more engaging for children to
          use. We found that there are no direct competitors in the market,
          which is good.
        </p>
        <p>
          We then expanded the scope of the research to include health rating
          apps and children using health apps.
        </p>
        <p>
          We found that kids' health apps tend to use games and rewards to keep
          kids coming back.
