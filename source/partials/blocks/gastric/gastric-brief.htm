          All kids had experience of occasional stomach ache. However, the diagnosis has never been easy because children find it challenging to adequately articulate their symptoms. Even some parents feel uncertain on how to address their child’s pain as well.

        <p>
          This is my first project working at NIHI (the National Institute for Health Innovation ).
        </p>
        <p>
          The task is to design and build a paediatrics version of Alimetryᵀᴹ app. To enable children, aged 5 -17 years, to record gastric symptoms once a day, for 7 days before clinic day .
        </p>
        <p>
          The adult Alimetryᵀᴹ app is only for recording symptoms on the clinic day, the task needs to add a new user flow of symptom tracking for 7 days, as it gives a more accurate picture over time.

        <p>
          <b>
          Converting the existing adult version app to a children's version, with a new 7 days tracking user flow.  
          </b>
        </p>
        <p>
          The aim is to capture and record data for research analyses and in the end helping to diagnose and inform personalized therapy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The APP needs to be clear and simple for the little ones to use. The UI design should be based on the adult version with the same logo and branding colour.

        <h3>A positive start...and still Day One</h3>
        <p>
          After completing the initial version, I moved on to a new project. However, I later found out from my colleagues that the first version of our product was being used by specialists and PhDs, with over two dozen paediatric patients benefiting from it. 
        </p>
        <p>
          While our clients were pleased with the valuable data collected, issues were also identified, including the need to redesign the admin dashboard and accommodate the varying needs of older and younger children.

        <p>My role</p> 
        <p>There were 4 designers in the team. We had separate roles and some joint tasks.<br/>Using my early childhood education experience, I was able to contribute more to this project, which I really enjoyed.
          I started from research to conduct the first version prototype. 
          I moved on to another project after the first prototype handing over to the developers. The remaining designers continue the user test and iteration.
