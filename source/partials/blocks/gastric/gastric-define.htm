            The existing gastric app is used by adults to track and rate the
            severity of their gastric symptoms; however, it is not suitable for
            use by children (5 â€“ 18 years old). The current app is only for use
            at the clinic, it has no ability to track symptoms in the week
            leading up to clinic day
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="highlight-section">
          <img src="images/portfolio/gastric/arrow.png" />
          <p>
            Because children have a different level of health literacy, they may
            not understand the ratings, making them inaccurate. Without keeping
            track of seven days, the participants must recall the symptoms they
            experienced during the week, which is more difficult for children to
            do.

          <p>
            As a result, it is unlikely the researcher can get accurate
            information during the 7 days leading up to clinic day, so the
            diagnosis may be inaccurate.
